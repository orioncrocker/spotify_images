# spotify\_images
`spotify_images` provides a simple method of retrieving all unique album art from either a Spotify playlist or artist on Spotify and creating a collage from the query.

## Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/orioncrocker/spotify_images
```

## Setup:
Before using this program, you'll need to get credentials from [Spotify's API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/).
An account on Spotify will provide two credentials: 'client id' and 'client secret.'

Modify the `config.py` file's two fields:
```python
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
```

Two prerequisites you'll need installed on your machine are pillow and spotipy.
You can easily get both of these from the `pip` repository after you've set up a virtual python3 environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/vin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage:

## Download album art from an artist or playlist:
By default `spotify_images` fetches all unique art of any Spotify arist or playlist link given as an argument
```bash
python3 main.py https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13OSe3KLY2qnUrdP2Sv6j7
```

## Verbose
Use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to see what the program is doing in real time.

## Create a collage
Use the `-c` or `--collage` collage flag to create a collage of the artwork downloaded.

```bash
python3 main.py -vc https://open.spotify.com/playlist/13OSe3KLY2qnUrdP2Sv6j7

## Future features:
A website that hosts this code via [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) 
would be ideal so that anyone could utilize this software without the hassle of installation and configuration.
However if I'm going do that I may as well rewrite this program in Javascript and save myself some trouble.
